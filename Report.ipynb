    "# Introduction\n",
    "During the COVID-19 pandemic, traffic all around the world decreased and roads were nearly empty. After the pandemic, a lot of companies in the Netherlands allowed their employees to work from home (fully or partially). It would be expected that this has an influence on the traffic patterns. In the Netherlands Tuesdays and Thursdays are by far the busiest days for commuting trips (ANWB, 2023). This has been the same before the pandemic when most people went to the office five days a week, but interestingly ANWB stated that in 2023 the heaviness of traffic jams (the length times the duration) increased with 17% compared to earlier years. They say that the effect of remote working cannot be seen in the data regarding traffic jams (ANWB, 2023). In 2023, compared to 2019 there were 470.000 more cars on the roads which has impact on the traffic jams (NOS, 2023a), and a research from Kantar Public (NOS, 2023b) showed that there were more car movements on each day in 2023 compared to 2019. \n",

    "# Results analysis and interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of average commuting per person per weekday, presents a declining trend in total commuting trips from 2018 to 2019, with a more pronounced reduction—approximately 20% on average - over the last two years. This decline is not associated with unemployment rates, as the unemployment rates in 2018 and 2019 (4.87% and 4.45%) were actually higher than in 2022 and 2023 (3.52% and 3.55%) in the Netherlands, according to CBS StatLine. This suggests that the rise in remote work post-pandemic has significantly reduced commuting trips, as many employees no longer need to go to work everyday.\n",
    "In addition, during the last two years, most commuting trips were done on Tuesdays, followed by Thursdays, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. This pattern diverges from 2018 and 2019, when Mondays were as significant as or more than Thursdays. This shift reflects the current situation among hybrid-schedules works, who typically do not travel to the office on Mondays and Fridays.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The same patterns / different patterns are observed in traffic jams data….\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, average commuting trips increased by 4% in 2023 compared to 2022, suggesting that companies may be gradually encouraging employees to work on-office more frequently.\n"
